Description:
    HLS pragmas can be used to optimize the design : improve throughput, reduce latency and 
    device resource utilization of the resulting RTL code
    This is vector addition example to demonstrate how HLS optimizations are used in kernel.

// All the global memory access arguments must be associated to one m_axi(AXI Master Interface). Here all three arguments(in1, in2, out) are
